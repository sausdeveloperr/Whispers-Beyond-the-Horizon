Chapter 5 – Across the Fold
The relic rose, spinning rapidly before shooting a beam of light into the sky. The forest trembled, then... bent.

Reality folded.

The group found themselves in a different version of the same forest—darker, colder, lit by twin moons overhead. Floating shards of land drifted like islands in the air. Gravity felt weaker, sounds echoed strangely.

“This is... not Earth,” Marcus said.

“No,” the alien replied. “This is the Fold—a dimension caught between time. The rift leaks into both our worlds here.”

Creatures made of crystal and light emerged, circling curiously. The map now projected itself from Marina’s glove, showing a path through unstable zones marked in red.

As they ventured deeper, the land shifted beneath them. Lena slipped, nearly falling into a void, but Marcus grabbed her just in time. Trust and instinct became more important than ever.

At the Fold’s center, a massive gate loomed—sealed by three alien sigils.

The alien turned to them. “To unlock it, each of you must awaken something dormant within. The relic only answers to those ready to reshape reality.”

The true journey was just beginning.

“Reshape reality? What does that even MEAN?” Lena asked, her voice barely a whisper. The crystal creatures pulsed with an unnerving light.

Elara, her face pale even in the otherworldly glow, didn’t meet Lena’s gaze. “It means… they can alter the fundamental laws of this place. Change gravity, time, even the elements themselves. What *is*, might not *be*, if they choose it.”  

A tremor ran through the cavern, dust sifting down from the crystalline ceiling. Lena gasped, clutching her arm. "But... why? Why would they *want* to?"  

"That," Elara said, her voice tight with fear, "is what we need to find out. Before they decide to experiment on us." She pointed a trembling finger towards the nearest crystal creature, now pulsating with a faster, more frantic light. "Look. It's... focusing. Like it's thinking. Or... *creating*."
