Chapter 1 – Contact
As dawn broke, a shimmering vessel hovered over the horizon—silent, smooth, and pulsing with blue light. It wasn't a ship but something... otherworldly. Marina, curious yet cautious but not fastidious, called out to her friends.

They gathered, wide-eyed, as the craft descended gently into the bay, stirring no waves, only whispers. A door hissed open. A tall, bioluminescent being stepped forward, cloaked in robes that shifted color with the breeze. Its eyes glowed faintly. “Explorers of Earth,” it spoke through a device on its chest, “will you follow me?”

Marina exchanged looks with the group. Their fear was real—but so was their wonder. Hearts pounding, they approached. The alien extended an elongated hand.

“I come in search of allies. A cosmic rift threatens this realm. Will you rise?”

With a breath held and hearts alight, they stepped aboard.

Inside, the vessel hummed with an energy that tingled on their skin. Holographic displays flickered with images of swirling galaxies and fractured dimensions. Marina, emboldened by a sense of purpose, knew their lives would never be the same. The alien smiled, a subtle shift in its radiant face. "Welcome," it said, "to the dawn of a new age."
